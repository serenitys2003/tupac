      tupac is a hero in my eyes not like most african american black men back then, Tupac stood up for not just 
      woman rights he stood up for all african american people and his music still helps blacks till this day 
      the music he made was inspirational the movies he played in was not like any other movie they had meaning.

      people veiw tupac many types of ways some say tupac was a legand some say he was nothing more then just another 
      black man from the hood but me i think of him as a legand, Someone you can be happy to look up to.

      Tupac said many different things, He did many different things and all the things he did was for us so we can have 
      a better life being black, Not being ashamed of your skin tone, Not pushing it away but to inbrace it.
